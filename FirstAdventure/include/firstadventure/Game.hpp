/*
 The Game class is responsbile for creating and running the game and its state.
 It uses the State Pattern (http://www.gameprogrammingpatterns.com/state.html) to control the games state via the GameState class.
 
 The class has a NotificationEngine component which acts as the 'Subscriber' in the Observer Pattern.
 The Notifiers (and their implementations) are the 'Observers'.  See here: http://www.gameprogrammingpatterns.com/observer.html.
