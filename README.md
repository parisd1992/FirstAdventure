# Project Goals
A simple Text Adventure Game in C++ called 'First Adventure'.  

The aim of this project is to practice C++, design patterns and do some basic game development.  
As this is an education exercise, some of the code is purposefully over engineered and inefficient.

# Design Patterns
The code touches on a number of design patterns:

- Component (http://www.gameprogrammingpatterns.com/component.html)
- Command (http://www.gameprogrammingpatterns.com/command.html)
- State (http://www.gameprogrammingpatterns.com/state.html)
- Observer (http://www.gameprogrammingpatterns.com/observer.html)
- Object Pool (http://www.gameprogrammingpatterns.com/object-pool.html)

# Improvements

There are a number of design and structural improvements which could be made to the code.  
Most of these are marked out as TODO comments.  
As this is an education exercise, these improvements are beyond the scope of this project.

# Next Steps

- Improve Entity initialisation

The game entities are initialised in the Game class as part of the initialise() method.
